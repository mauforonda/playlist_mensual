A script to archive my Spotify likes in monthly playlists.

`like_archiver.py` is full of annotations for how this could improve. Some general directions could be:

- **Make this a reliable script**. Well tested, that knows how to handle all sorts of errors and situations, that is easy for another person to run on their own.
- **How flexible and expansive should this be?**. What other archives or playlists are possible and interesting? Is this about representing the feeling of a period or about making custom playlists?
- **How to package this?**. Imagine I want to share this for others to use, what is the best way?
